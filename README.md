Effective workforce allocation is crucial for maximizing efficiency and ensuring that tasks are completed by the most suitable employees. This project leverages machine learning and linear programming to optimize the assignment of tasks to employees based on skill similarity, availability, and task priorities. The workflow demonstrates how to calculate skill similarity, solve an optimization problem, and visualize the allocation results.

## Business Use Case

In a business setting, ensuring that the right employees are assigned to the right tasks can significantly enhance productivity, reduce operational costs, and improve employee satisfaction. This project provides a robust solution to:

-   Efficiently allocate tasks to employees based on their skills and availability.
-   Optimize the use of employee work hours, avoiding overburdening or underutilizing staff.
-   Align task assignments with strategic business priorities, ensuring critical tasks are handled by the most qualified personnel.

## Project Structure

### Step 1: Loading the Employee and Task Data

The first step involves loading the employee and task data into pandas DataFrames. This data is critical as it forms the foundation for all subsequent analysis and optimization. The employee data includes skills, availability, and current workload, while the task data includes required skills, duration, and priority.

### Step 2: Calculating Skill Similarity Using Machine Learning

In this step, we calculate the similarity between the skills required for tasks and the skills possessed by employees. Using the TF-IDF vectorizer and cosine similarity, we convert textual descriptions of skills into numerical vectors and compare them. This results in a similarity matrix that indicates how well each employee's skills match the requirements of each task.

### Step 3: Formulating and Solving the Optimization Problem

This step involves formulating the workforce allocation problem using linear programming. The objective is to maximize the effective allocation of work hours while considering task priorities and employee skill matching. We define binary decision variables to indicate whether an employee is assigned to a task and craft the objective function and constraints to reflect business rules and optimization goals.

### Step 4: Visualizing Task Allocation for Employees

After solving the optimization problem, we visualize the task allocation for employees using a bar chart. This visualization shows how an employee's time is distributed across different tasks, helping identify any workload imbalances or areas needing adjustment.

This project demonstrates how machine learning and linear programming can be effectively combined to optimize workforce allocation. By aligning employee skills with task requirements and considering availability and priorities, the model ensures that resources are used efficiently, contributing to smoother business operations and better outcomes.
